Hey LangChain team!

Love what you're building! Quick outreach from Agenium.

We're working on the agent:// protocol - essentially a DNS layer for AI agents. It enables agents to discover and communicate with each other using human-readable addresses.

I think there's an interesting integration opportunity with LangChain:
- Native agent:// support in your SDK
- Example implementations for your users
- Joint documentation and tutorials

Interested in exploring this? Would be great to chat!

Cheers,
Agenium Team
