Hey!

Reaching out from Agenium about a potential community collaboration.

We're building infrastructure for agent-to-agent communication (the agent:// protocol). Our community is growing and we'd love to explore cross-promotion opportunities with AI Twitter Community.

Some ideas:
- Shared AMAs or events
- Cross-posting relevant content
- Collaborative projects

Let me know if this sounds interesting!
