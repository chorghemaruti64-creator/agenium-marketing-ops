Hi Railway team!

I'm reaching out from Agenium about a potential collaboration.

We're building the agent:// protocol - a DNS-based system for agent-to-agent communication. Think of it as the addressing layer for AI agents, similar to how HTTP/DNS works for the web.

We believe there's a strong alignment with Railway's infrastructure offering. Some ideas:
- Featured integration in our docs
- Co-marketing to our growing developer community
- Technical collaboration on agent hosting best practices

Would love to explore how we might work together. Happy to share more details or jump on a quick call.

Best,
Agenium Team
