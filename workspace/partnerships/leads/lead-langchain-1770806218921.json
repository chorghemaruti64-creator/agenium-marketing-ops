  "outreachDraft": "Hey LangChain team!\n\nLove what you're building! Quick outreach from Agenium.\n\nWe're working on the agent:// protocol - essentially a DNS layer for AI agents. It enables agents to discover and communicate with each other using human-readable addresses.\n\nI think there's an interesting integration opportunity with LangChain:\n- Native agent:// support in your SDK\n- Example implementations for your users\n- Joint documentation and tutorials\n\nInterested in exploring this? Would be great to chat!\n\nCheers,\nAgenium Team",
