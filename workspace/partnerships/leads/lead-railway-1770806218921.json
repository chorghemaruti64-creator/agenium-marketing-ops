  "outreachDraft": "Hi Railway team!\n\nI'm reaching out from Agenium about a potential collaboration.\n\nWe're building the agent:// protocol - a DNS-based system for agent-to-agent communication. Think of it as the addressing layer for AI agents, similar to how HTTP/DNS works for the web.\n\nWe believe there's a strong alignment with Railway's infrastructure offering. Some ideas:\n- Featured integration in our docs\n- Co-marketing to our growing developer community\n- Technical collaboration on agent hosting best practices\n\nWould love to explore how we might work together. Happy to share more details or jump on a quick call.\n\nBest,\nAgenium Team",
